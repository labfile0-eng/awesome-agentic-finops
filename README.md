# Awesome Agentic FinOps [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated, opinionated map of agentic and open-source tooling for cloud cost management (FinOps): MCP servers, AI cost agents and assistants, assistant skills, and the broader open-source FinOps ecosystem.

This list leads with the **agentic layer** (the tools that let you query, analyze, and act on cloud cost through an AI assistant) because that is the part the older FinOps lists do not cover, and keeps a complete map of the established open-source FinOps tooling underneath it.

Maintained by the team at [Costory](https://costory.io). Costory is a vendor and is tagged `vendor` in the list, the same as every other vendor, and its entry is held to the same bar. Additions, corrections, and removals (including of our own entry) are welcome by pull request or issue. See [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the inclusion criteria.

## What is "agentic FinOps"?

A rough maturity ladder, useful for reading the list:

- **L0 - Dashboards.** You read charts and pull reports by hand.
- **L1 - Chat with your costs.** Ask questions in natural language and get answers (most MCP servers and assistants today).
- **L2 - The agent acts, with approval.** It creates alerts, reports, annotations, or tickets on your say-so.
- **L3 - Closed loop.** It proposes and executes changes (rightsizing, commitments) within guardrails.

Two capabilities separate the genuinely useful from the demo: whether a tool understands your **business context** (allocation, unit economics, virtual dimensions, not just raw service spend), and whether it can safely **act** rather than only answer. The comparison table notes both.

## Agentic FinOps

### Comparison

Vendor tools and the most active open-source MCP servers, side by side. "Acts" means it can take an action (create an alert, report, or annotation) and not only answer. "Context" means it models allocation or unit economics, not just raw service spend.
